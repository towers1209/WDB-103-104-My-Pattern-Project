# WDB-103-104-My-Pattern-Project
Repo for my "Pattern" project for lessons 103 and 104 in Section 9 Bootstrap 4: Flexbox and Layout.

There are two html pages -- index01.html and index02.html. index01.html shows the progression of the discussion in the lecture video. index02.html is the final (clean) version of the project.

NOTE: It takes time to get the hang of Bootstrap 4.  But it gets easier with use.
